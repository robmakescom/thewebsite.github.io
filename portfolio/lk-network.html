                        <h2>The Project</h2>
                        <p>Create an app like Kayak.com that allows borrowers to view all available lenders based on their credit profile. They should be able to sort and filter loan offers to select the best one for them. Further, to create a brand standard with consistent and common UI across all products.</p>

                        <h2 class="mt60">Business Requirements</h2>
                        <p>Collecting business requirements was a tedious task. What information did we <em>need</em> to get from the user? Could we issue a "soft pull" from the credit bureaus to pre-approve them? What is the "field of membership" for each partnering credit union?</p>
                        <p>The answers existed, but it took working with multiple departments to first understand the questions, then get them resolved.</p>

                        <p>What information to ask from users, and when, are issues each of the competitors handle differently. I looked into how they presented rates, what the various calls to action were, and even the legal language they presented at specific steps.</p>

                        <h2>Process</h2>
                        <p>After generating personas I was eager to get my hands dirty and dug into paper prototypes. The LendKey Network is quite complex, with a lot of moving parts and necessary steps.</p>
                        <p>The agility of paper prototypes allowed me to easily test with internal users and iterate on the fly.</p>

                        <h2>Sprint Planning</h2>
                        <p>The paper prototypes matured into low-fidelity wireframes and it was time to begin working with Product Owners and Tech Leads to understand the compexity of the project and estimate epics.</p>
                        <p>I created a detailed process flow to walk through each step, aiding in the understanding of the product and its intracacies.</p>

                        <p>Though the project's MVP was desktop only, as filtered by <a href="https://www.optimizely.com/" target="_blank">Optimizely</a>, I wanted to ensure we weren't painting ourselves into a corner if and when they decided to expand the product's accessibility onto mobile and tablet.</p>

                                <p class="white">The results? Of course, the things I assumed would be easy for the user proved incredibly difficult and confusing - and vice versa.</p>

                        <p>Feedback from user testing included how they were confused about what step(s) to take next, and how it wasn't clear <em>why</em> they were answering particular questions.</p>
                        <p>By cleaning up the UI, adding grouped question areas along the vertical wizard, help text and tooltips, and driving focus to the specific sort type, the interface became easier to understand and offered more incentive to complete it.</p>

                        <p>After we were pleased with the results of our user tested visual design, I coded up <a href="http://opuscule.com/lk-network/landing.html" target="_blank">a clickable prototype</a> that the <a href="http://finovate.com/lendkeys-marketplace-creates-low-cost-lending-options/" target="_blank">CEO would share on stage</a>.
