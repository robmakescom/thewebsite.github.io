                        <h2>The Problem</h2>
                        <p>OnDeck’s mobile app currently shows when a customer is eligible, but to apply for that renewal loan, the customer must call the sales team - they are not able to do it on the app.</p>
                       <p>How do we present the complex information required and ensure the user fully understands their loan amount, terms and amount deposited into their bank account? Now do all of that while staying on brand, considering the rest of the user flows across the loan experience, and making it consistent for iOS and Android devices.</p>
                        <h2 class="mt40">User Flow &amp; Wireframes</h2>
                        <p>Fortunately, the renewal experience already exists for desktop, so I had a good jumping off point. I worked with the product owner to create medium fidelity wireframes and ensure we had all interactions accounted for.</p>

                        <h2 class="mt40">Research</h2>
                        <p>One of the biggest challenges is explaining to users that their NEW loan is first used to pay off their EXISTING loan, then the balance is deposited into their bank account. User feedback from the desktop revealed that customers were definitely confused at the process. As an example, there are untold stories of customers calling in a panic about them having been approved for a $60,000 renewal loan, but only $42,000 was put into their account.</p>
                        <p>Recently OnDeck had been partnering with a third party to offer their lending solutions and I worked with the team to create a solution to combat this issue there. Some of the findings were used for this scenario.</p>

                    	<p class="mt20">After six user tests, the results showed that all users thought the renewal process itself was easy to complete (one user had issue with the task wording, but still completed the application itself easily). The majority of users bypassed the other offers pursuing the call to action to click the first shown option.</p> 
                    	<p>On the term details page, users with larger phones did not view the loan details box, as it looked like everything was visible. Regarding editing fields, only one user explicitly mentioned them. She mentioned that she did like the way the information was clearly laid out.</p>
                    	<p>The <strong>recommended actions</strong> were to: show all offers by default and have an indication that there is more content below the break on the "Term Details" page. This was done by removing the sticky "Continue" button forcing the user to scroll down and see the table.</p>
                    	
                    	<h4 class="mt60">Rebrand</h4>
                    	<p>While I was designing this new experience, there was a simultaneous rebrand happening across the company, which is why you may see different logos and colors on some of the mockups.</p>
                    	<p>The product team requested this feature and the app launch at the same time as the new public site and rebrand, so I worked with the developers to supply assets, creating new icons and updating content and elements to be on brand. Dozens of new icons were created for iOS and Android.</p>

                    	<h4 class="mt60">Launch</h4>
                    	<p>After four sprints, the design was completed and uploaded to <a href="https://zeplin.io/" target="_blank">Zeplin</a>, where the developers were able to find presentation specs and download SVGs if they needed. You can see the updated app in the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ondeck-capital/id1014118058?mt=8" target="_blank">iTunes store</a> and on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ondeck" target="_blank">Google Play</a>.</p>
